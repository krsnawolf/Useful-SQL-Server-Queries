Useful-SQL-Server-Queries
=========================

This is a collection of queries that I use when dealing with SQL Server, whether I'm looking to improve performance, diagnose IO issues or setup the server.

Some scripts are made wholly by me, while some are inspired by others - in which case they're properly attributed. If you see anything you don't think belongs here, please let me know at kishan@tuta.io.
